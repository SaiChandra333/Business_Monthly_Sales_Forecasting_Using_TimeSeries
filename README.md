# Business_Monthly_Sales_Forecasting_Using_TimeSeries
My Project is about Business Monthly Sales Forecasting using Time Series algorithm. The dataset comprises financial and operational data of a business, with the aim of extracting insights for informed decisions. Analyses encompass data preprocessing, visualization, statistical assessment, and predictive modeling. 
Time series analysis highlights trends, seasonality, and patterns. ARIMA and SARIMA models predict future values, aided by accuracy metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and MAE to gauge forecast reliability.
Visualizations, like scatter and pair plots, unravel relationships among variables. For instance, sales quantity and revenue connections are elucidated.
These efforts yield significant insights: spotting trends, predicting future performance, recognizing relationships, and assessing forecast accuracy. These insights empower data-driven decisions, optimizing operations, and steering financial growth.
